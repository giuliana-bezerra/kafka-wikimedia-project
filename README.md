# Kafka Wikimedia Project

This project reads data from a stream (https://stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange), produces this data into a kafka topic (using a Kafka Producer), consume this data from the topic and print it out in the console. 

This project was created [in this course]https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/), but I have adapted to use Spring Boot.
